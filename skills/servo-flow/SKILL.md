# servo-flow

servo runs a piece of work as a feedback loop, not a straight line. Each phase boundary re-grounds against the project's oracles and gates the artifact against ground truth before moving on. The premise: the agent is a high-gain actuator with no damping — left alone it converges fast and confidently, even on the wrong answer. The phases supply the damping.

## The phases

```
scan-project → gather-context → expert-panel → shape-spec ⟂gate→ seal-plan ⟂gate→ execute ⟂scope-watch ⟂gate→ close-the-books
```

| Phase | Skill | When |
|---|---|---|
| Map the project | `scan-project` | once per project: discover the manifest (oracles + experts) |
| Ground | `gather-context` | at the start, and again at every phase boundary |
| Diverge | `expert-panel` | only for decisions with no ground truth yet (the real forks) |
| Spec | `shape-spec` → `servo-gate` | shape the spec, then gate it against invariants/scope |
| Plan | `seal-plan` → `servo-gate` | write a closed plan, then gate it against the spec |
| Execute | (TDD) + `scope-watch` → `servo-gate` | build, watching for drift, gating the diff |
| Done | `close-the-books` | reconcile every criterion and invariant |

## Two things that hold across all phases

- **The human is a seat at the table, not ceremony.** Always the *client* (nothing ships without their OK). Often the *CEO* (they carry the intent). Sometimes also an *expert* (they contribute, and get challenged like any expert). Capture their input richly, in batches — then pressure-test it.

- **Verification only counts if it injects ground truth the producer did not have.** Every gate names an oracle. A check that re-reads the artifact with the same context that wrote it is theater. Skip it.

## Show the work — keep a live checklist

The phases are only damping if the human can *see* them happen. At the start of a servo run, open a **TodoWrite checklist with one item per phase** you intend to run (skip the ones that don't apply), and walk it: mark a phase `in_progress` when you enter it, `completed` when its gate passes. When a phase fans out, expand it into sub-items — **one todo per expert** in `expert-panel`, **one todo per task** when executing a sealed plan, one per verifier in a multi-gate. The checklist is the visible spine of the run; never do a multi-phase servo run as a silent block of work.

## Depth — choose how much rigor to spend

The fan-out (panels, gates, multiple verifiers) is where the cost is. Pick a depth up front and tell the phases:

- **`quick` (default for most work):** the minimal relevant experts (2-3) on a cheap model, fed the context brief; gates run a **single** oracle-grounded verifier; reason inline rather than spawning when a fork is low-stakes. This is the everyday setting.
- **`thorough` (high-stakes only):** widen the panel, run a multi-verifier gate, use the strong model for synthesis and final verification. Reserve for the irreversible, the security-sensitive, the expensive-to-reverse.

A project can set its default depth in the manifest; a task can override it ("this one's high-stakes, go thorough"). When unsure, start `quick` — a single oracle-grounded gate already catches most stale-premise and scope problems. Escalate only when being wrong is expensive.

## Skip what does not apply

Small, well-scoped work does not need the whole loop. A one-line fix needs `servo-gate` against `scope` at most. Reach for `expert-panel` only when there is a genuine fork. The loop scales down; do not run ceremony for its own sake.
